All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

Breaking change: Project has been renamed from `master_proxy` to `main_proxy`.
To upgrade your project do a search and replace of:
- `MasterProxy` -> `MainProxy`
- `master_proxy` -> `main_proxy`

The flexibility of MainProxy has been increased and it is now possible to
generate configuration at runtime during application startup.

Breaking change: You must create a `MyApp.Proxy` module that calls `use
MainProxy`. This allows configuration to be generated at runtime which is
important for usage with SiteEncrypt along with other setups.

Example module:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Proxy do
  use MainProxy.Proxy
end
```

The proxy must then be explicitly started as part of your application
supervision tree. Proxies can be added to the supervision tree as follows
(usually in `MyApp.Application`):

```elixir
children = [
  # ... other children
  MyApp.Proxy,
]
```

You can also move your `backends` configuration into your `MyApp.Proxy` module
instead of inside application configuration. This change is in line with the
["Avoid application
configuration"](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.13/library-guidelines.html#avoid-application-configuration)
library guideline.

See `MainProxy.Proxy` docs for details about the new module.

### Added
- Add server and domain options [#16](https://github.com/Main-Proxy/main_proxy/pull/16)
  - Domain allows you to check if a request matches the given domain without using a regex
